# diepAPI

#### This is a WIP Project that I'm developing to create self playing bots in the future.

### State of the API: `SUPER DUPER UNSTABLE`

### Building:

Since this API is still in an early stage, the bundled library is not included.
To build the api yourself clone this repo and run:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

### Usage:

include the bundled library in your script and access the api by the global Object `diepAPI`.
Refer to the documentation and examples for more information.

### Documentation:
