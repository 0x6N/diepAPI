# diepAPI

#### This is a WIP Project that I'm developing to create self playing bots in the future.

### State of the API: `STABLE`

| Class         | Status   |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Game          | STABLE   |
| Minimap       | STABLE   |
| ArenaScaling  | STABLE   |
| Arena         | STABLE   |
| Player        | STABLE   |
| EntityManager | STABLE   |

### Building:

You can build the library yourself or use my prebuild version that can be found [here](https://github.com/Cazka/diepAPI/releases/).

```
git clone https://github.com/Cazka/diepAPI.git
npm install
npm run build
```

### Working with the API:

include the bundled library in your script and access the api by the global Object `diepAPI`.
Refer to the documentation and examples for more information.
